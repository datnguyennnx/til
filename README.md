# Today I Learned (TIL)

Every day, we encounter new insights, whether they’re technical breakthroughs, fascinating libraries, or life lessons. Too often, these fleeting moments of learning pass by unrecorded. As a software engineer, I wanted a better way to track, organize, and revisit these lessons.

Instead of letting them vanish into forgotten notes or apps, I decided to organize everything here on GitHub. This repository will serve as a long-term tracker of what I learn, powered by GitHub Issues. It’s not just a place for technology or engineering topics—it's also about life, discovery, and personal growth.

Each new learning is logged as a GitHub Issue. This approach keeps things organized, searchable, and shareable. Whether you're exploring a new library, gaining insights into a framework, or reflecting on an important lesson, it all goes here.

- **Add Your Own TIL:** Feel free to explore or contribute your ideas by creating a new issue.
